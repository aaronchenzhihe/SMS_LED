## Introduction

QuecPython has introduced a remote control method for LED lights, such as SMS control LED on and off.

With the QuectPython-encapsulated interface, remote control of lights can be easily achieved in just a few steps, eliminating the need for traditional manual switching.

## Features

- **Identify custom verification code ** : If you want to control the device, you need to send a command (LIGHT) with the correct verification code to the device to improve device security.

-  **LIGHT L1 ON** : The mobile phone sends verification code (LIGHT) + Custom device number (L1) + Device action (ON) to enable L1 device to turn on lights
-  **LIGHT L1 OFF** : The mobile phone sends verification code (LIGHT) + Custom device number (L1) + device action (OFF) to turn off the light of the L1 device

### Prerequisites



Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Hardware**:
  - A QuecPython wearable development board
  - USB Data Cable (USB-A to USB-C)
  - PC (Windows 7, Windows 10, or Windows 11)
- **Software**:
  - USB driver for the QuecPython module
  - QPYcom debugging tool
  - QuecPython firmware and related software resources
  - Python text editor (e.g., [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/))

### Installation



1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/aaronchenzhihe/SMS_LED.git
   cd LED_SMS
   ```

   

2. **Flash the Firmware**:

   Follow the [instructions](https://python.quectel.com/doc/Application_guide/en/dev-tools/QPYcom/qpycom-dw.html#Download-Firmware) to flash the firmware to the development board.

### Running the Application



1. **Connect the Hardware**:
   - Insert the SIM card into the SIM card slot.
   - Connect the antenna.
   - Use a USB data cable to connect the development board to the computer's USB port.
2. **Download Code to the Device**:
   - Launch the QPYcom debugging tool.
   - Connect the data cable to the computer.
   - Press the **PWRKEY** button on the development board to start the device.
   - Follow the [instructions](https://python.quectel.com/doc/Application_guide/en/dev-tools/QPYcom/qpycom-dw.html#Download-Script) to import all files within the `code` folder into the module's file system, preserving the directory structure.
3. **Run the Application**:
   - Select the `File` tab.
   - Select the `main_t.py` script.
